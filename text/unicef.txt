UNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection of
children's rights, to help meet their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach
their full potential. UNICEF is guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and
strives to establish children's rights as enduring ethical principles and international
standards of behaviour towards children. UNICEF insists that the survival, protection and
development of children are universal development imperatives that are integral to human
progress. UNICEF mobilizes political will and material resources to help countries,
particularly developing countries, ensure a first call for children and to build their
capacity to form appropriate policies and deliver services for children and their families.
UNICEF is committed to ensuring special protection for the most disadvantaged children,
victims of war, disasters, extreme poverty, all forms of violence and exploitation,
and those with disabilities.
